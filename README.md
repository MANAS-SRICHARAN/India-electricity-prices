# India-electricity-prices :bulb:

## Intro:
   This project aims to visualize national :india: wide states electricity costs.
    
   ### DataSource: [Link](https://www.kitchenarena.in/state-wise-electricity-tariff-india).
    The data is html tabular data, with uncleaned hierarchial indexing that changes with respect to every state table.
    
   The analysis performed eliminates the state schemes,subsidiaries and also considering only one electricity provider arbitarily out of many and focusing only urban areas.
The accuracy is questionable as the Tarrifs keep changing and is independent to every state.

## Future Goal:
   The end goal is definitely to locate Tarrif data from multiple yet accurate and up-to-date resources and provide the visualization for both urban and rural areas across the nation. A one stop solution.
